      <h1>Setting up Node.js & Express.js backend</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <p>
        Next we need to set up our backend, we'll be using Node.js and
        Express.js
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's start to setup our file structure and create a folder called
        movie-reviews, and inside movie-reviews create another folder called
        'backend'
      </p>
      <p>
        After running npm init inside of backend, npm creates a package.json for
        us, which contains meta-data about our Node.js project
      </p>
      <p>
        Next inside our backend folder, run the following in order to install
        the dependencies we need
      </p>
      <p>npm install express cors mongodb dotenv</p>
      <p>
        After running, you'll notice in our package.json a new property
        'dependencies' has been created
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Express</h2>
      <p>
        Express is a framewok that acts as a layer atop Node.js web server
        making it much easier to develop web applications, it simplifies the
        API's of Node.js and adds helpful features, and assists us in organizing
        our apps web functionality with middleware, routing and many others
      </p>
      <h2>CORS</h2>
      <p>
        CORS or Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, by default modern browswers won't
        allow frontend clients to talk to REST API's
      </p>
      <p>
        The broswer will by default block the requests sent from client to
        server as a security mechanism, to make sure that the client-side
        browser JS code can ONLY talk to their own allowed server, not other
        servers that could potentially run mailcious code
      </p>
      <p>
        To circumvent this security mechanism, we can enable CORS checking,
        which will use additional HTTP headers to tell browsers to give a web
        app running at one origin, access to a specified resources at another
      </p>
      <p>
        The CORS package we installed earlier provides an Express.js middleware
        than can enable CORS with different options so we can make the correct
        connections on the network
      </p>
      <p>
        The mongodb package we installed allows us to interact with our MongoDB
        database
      </p>
      <p>
        And finally the dotenv loads environment variables from tue process.env
        file instead of setting environment variables on our development
        machine, which simplifies development work, we'll go into process.env in
        greater detail later
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <h2>What are dependencies anyway?</h2>
      <p>
        Well dependencies contain the dependency packages, and their specific
        version number like:
      </p>
      <p>"cors": "^2.8.5",</p>
      <p>
        Every single time we use 'npm install yadayada' npm will save and keep
        track of all the yadayadas and their version everytime
      </p>
      <p>
        How it works is that npm, when we use npm install, it will fetch the
        latest versions of what we want and auto-saves it in that folder called
        'node_modules'
      </p>
    </div>
  </body>
