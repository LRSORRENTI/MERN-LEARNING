      <p>
        We're going to set up MongoDB using it's cloud service Atlas to host our
        database in the cloud
      </p>
      <p>
        We could also set up MongoDB on our local machines for development and
        testing, however MongoDB Atlas will make things a lot easier even if
        we're doing a local project, and our entire front and backend will end
        up deployed on the cloud anyway
      </p>
      <p>
        Just set up my MongoDB Account and set up new user with network access
      </p>

    <div class="container">
      <h2>Adding sample data</h2>
      <p>
        One nice thing about MongoDB is that we don't need to generate our own
        test data, MongoDB cam provide sample data for us
      </p>
      <p>
        We just press "Load sample data", and MongoDB will generate sample data
        for us to use
      </p>
