      <h1>MongoDB Overview</h1>
      <p>
        As indicated by the "M" in MERN, MongoDb will serve as our backend
        database for our app.
      </p>
      <p>
        MongoDB is noSQL, meaning it doesn't use structured query language (I do
        need to learn SQL and mySQL/ PostgreSQL later as I know many employers
        are looking for that as a skill)
      </p>
      <p>
        The architecture of a NoSQL database like MongoDB is such that it stores
        data in the form of collections and documents
      </p>
      <p>
        A collection represents a single entity in our app, for example in a
        e-commerce store app, we'd have entities for categories, products, and
        users in the e-commerce store, And each of these woukd be a 'collection'
        in our database
      </p>
      <p>
        Inside of our collections we store DOCUMENTS, these documents are an
        instance of the entry containing various values is key value pairs,
        like:

        Documents look very similar to JSON objects, though they are technically
        Binary JSON or BSON
