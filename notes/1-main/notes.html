        These will be notes I'll take during this MERN adventure, probably going
        to be tough, but that's the only way to grow and improve

      <h2>What is MERN?</h2>
      <p>Just a quick overview before we dive in, MERN stands for:</p>
      <p>
        M: MongoDB, a noSQL database which stores data persistently in the form
        of collections and documents, MongoDB will be hosted on MongoDB Atlas
      </p>
      <p>
        E: Express.js, is a web application framework for Node.js that makes app
        development in Node easier and faster. Node and Express will work in
        unison to form the middle-tier of the web server in the stack, this will
        be hosted on Heroku
      </p>
      <p>
        R: React.js, React is a JavaScript frontend library developed by
        FaceBook to build user interfaces, this is where we'll call our API and
        render the content on the clients browser dynamically, will be hosted on
        Netlify
      </p>
      <p>
        N: Node.js, Node is one of the most popular server-side frameworks that
        allows JS to execute inside a web server, we'll also be hosting on this
        on Heroku
      </p>
      <p>
        It's important to note these stacks like MERN, MEA(Angular.js)N and
        MEV(Vue.js)N are used to build SPA's or single page applications, which
        is a really cool idea where content is rendered in components
        dynamically vs reloading a webpage entirely in a traditional website or
        web app
      </p>

      <h2>Movie Review App</h2>
      <p>
        We're going to build a fully customized movie review app in this course,
        they'll let users view and search for movies, as well as login to leave
        custom reviews on any given movie
